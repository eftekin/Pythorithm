# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional
# array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
# Example
# Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
# 3,5
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

X, Y = map(int, input("Enter two digits (X,Y): ").split(","))

array = [[0 for j in range(Y)] for i in range(X)]

for i in range(X):
    for j in range(Y):
        array[i][j] = i * j


for row in array:
    print(row)
